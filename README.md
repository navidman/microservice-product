Hello, I'm Navid Mansouri and this is snap pay test project.

As you can see this is lumen project and I implemented jwt authorization for my app 
in the other app. I also provided swagger api documentation you can check 
/api/documentation. I used Repositories, Facades, Services, Observers and Request 
classes in these two apps. Please once you cloned the project make database and config
it in .env, run these commands :
1.composer install
2.php artisan migrate
4.php -S localhost:8000 -t public
Now you can use postman to test this app.
Postman header configs :
Content-Type    application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization   Bearer <token>

I implemented observers and job to get models changes and publish in message broker.
So for authentication in this named you need to run both
projects at the same time and run <php artisan queue work> command on product app and
register your user on auth app and get token. rabbitmq will publish changes on user
model and here app will create the user too. so you can use your token on this app too.
please check .env and config/queue.php to configurate your rabbitmq server. I used
https://www.cloudamqp.com/ free services. You can use it too.

I hope you have fun using this app.
